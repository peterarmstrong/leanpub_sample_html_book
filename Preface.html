<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>A Leanpub book is composed of either a bunch of Markdown files or a bunch of HTML files.</p>
<p>The order of these files is defined in a file called Book.txt, which is in the same folder as this file.</p>
<p>This is the Leanpub sample book for an HTML book, so these files are HTML.  HTML is a good format for people who want to write their book in a visual editor, or for people who are importing their blogs.</p>
<p>Even if you know HTML, you need to learn a few things about how we use it at Leanpub.</p>
<p>First, we use h1 for chapters and h2 and below for sections.  This is true whether the book is a Markdown book or an HTML book.</p>
<p>So, if you look at the top of this file you'll see that it has one h1, meaning it is a Chapter.  (No, we don't do anything special for prefaces or appendices at Leanpub; we feel that ebooks are better served by having normal numbers as page numbers instead of Roman numerals.)</p>
<p>Another thing this means is that one file can contain as many chapters or sections as you want.  For example, the next few lines will create some chapters and sections.</p>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>This is chapter one.</p>
<h2>Chapter One, Section One</h2>
<p>This is section one in chapter one.</p>
<h2>## Chapter One, Section Two</h2>
<p>This is section two in chapter one.</p>
<h1># Chapter Two</h1>
<p>This is chapter two.</p>
<h2>Chapter Two, Section One</h2>
<p>This is section one in chapter two.</p>
<h1>Sample Books</h1>
<p>Leanpub also lets you create a sample book.  It's called Sample.txt, and it is in the same folder as this file.  Note that, like Book.txt, it is just as list of files.  It's supposed to be a smaller list than what is in Book.txt, or else you're giving your whole book away!  (If you don't want a sample book, just delete the Sample.txt file.)</p>
<p>Anyway, one consequence of the Sample.txt file approach to specifying a sample book is that it's an "all or nothing" thing to include a file.  If you include a file, all the chapters and sections in it are included.  Because of this, we recommend a couple things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Either use one chapter per file, or one section per file.</li>
<li>Never let a chapter's content span multiple files, unless that content is in sections.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two guidelines mean that your sample book is a lot less likely to have problems.  If you don't follow them, things can still work, but you can sometimes create a situation where your book will be created fine but your sample book will not.</p>
<p>(Note that this file actually breaks guideline #1!  If we were following it, then Chapter One and Chapter Two would be in their own files.)</p>
