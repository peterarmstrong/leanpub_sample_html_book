<p>That's it!</p>
<h2>Links Become Footnotes</h2>

<h2>Known Isssues</h2>
<h3>Chapters Can't Have Footnotes</h3>
<p>A chapter currently can't have footnotes, which means you can't put links in chapters since those get converted into footnotes.  (Yes, we're fixing that!  When it's fixed this document will be updated.)</p>
